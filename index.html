      <p>
     Automata is a self-operating machine that's made to follow responses that are created by other 
     mechanics. Most automaton machines were created by clock/watch makers that worked relatively similar as watches and clocks, though
     the machines were much more complicated and had more functions. Most of these machines are designed to give the illusion that they 
     operate on their own. They are seen as men's first robots.
      </p><p>  
      Automata have been around since the 12th/13th centuries. Even ancient Egyptians used these techniques to create automatons
      of their deities, these were made from stone, wood, and metal, not only to give them form but also motion and even a voice. 
      These machines were mostly used in religious ceremonies and gave the deities a soul as if they were alive. In Greek Mythology 
      automata were also used a lot.

     During the Hellenistic period, greek inventors mostly used automata as toys, tools, religious spectacles, or as prototypes for 
     demonstrating basic scientific principles. The greek inventor Ktesibios used water to make the machine whistle and make a model 
     owl move. If we fast forward in history we can see that automata was used more ambitiously and became more and more complicated 
    to make machines do things that were thought to only be possible by humans. Like playing instruments, writing, and even speaking.

      The First and most well-known Automaton Machines
      </h1>

      The first successfully built automaton was ''The Player Flute''. A biomechanical automaton that could play twelve songs and was built by 
      the French engineer Jacques de Vaucanson (1737). He also created ''The Digesting Duck'', which was a mechanical duck that could eat grain, or 
      at least it appeared that way. The duck could not do this as the grain was collected in a small container. Sadly the real duck was lost in 
      a fire that took place in the museum it was exposed to in 1879. This is not certain though. However, there is a replica made of this duck
      ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KiDQLb33gg">Video</a>.)

      One of the most well-known automaton machines is ''Da Vinci’s Knight''. An artificial knight that was designed by Da Vinci himself. The machine
      was to be powered by a mechanical crank that was external and use cables to make the knight stand, turn its head, lift up its metal visor and cross
      its arms. No complete drawings of the automaton were ever found, but evidence suggests that it could be possible that Da Vinci built a prototype in 
      1495. The roboticist Mark Rosheim created his own version of the automaton by using Da Vinci's notes and sketches. This project by Mark Rosheim showed 
      that the knight was fully functional.
      </p><p>
      The Jaquet-Droz’s Three Automatons is made by the inventor Pierre Jaquet-Droz who built it in 1768. Each of the characters had its own role. ''The Musician'' 
      could play five different songs on an actual organ that was functional, she was designed to lift her chest to give the illusion that she was ''breathing'' and 
      took bows in between tunes, ''The Writer'' sat behind a desk as it wrote 40 pre-programmed characters on a paper sheet and ''The Draughtsman'' drew 4 pictures 
      with a pen that also included a portrait of King Louis XV.

      How does Automata work?
      </h1> 

      <p>
     Automata machines operate by calculating a preset series of states or configurations. Each calculation means the movement of a certain part that 
    leads to another movement which the machine also calculated. 
    <p><p>  
    <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2004-05/automata-theory/basics.html#:~:text=Automatons%20are%20abstract%20models%20of,portion%20of%20the%20present%20configuration.">Bron 3. (Theory of Automata - Consulted: 02.10.2021)</a>
    <p><p> 
    A good example that's similar to the mechanics of an automaton machine is a music box. The song the music box plays is not something that's produced 
    by a speaker, like modern-day sound systems. The notes of the song that the music box plays, are made as pins to pluck the steel combs that produce the sound. 
    Almost like a mechanical guitar player. The music box is made to play that certain song since the pins are put in a specific location on the cylinder to produce 
    the song it's meant to play correctly. Like an automaton machine, the music box needs to be wind for the music box to be able to play the preset song. It will 
    only play the song it's made to play and will only do so when the music box is wind. This means that the music box needs to follow directions (in this case pluk 
    the notes) for it to complete its task.
    
    <p><p>
      
    This is also how an automaton machine works. It needs to follow the direction to operate and that is done by calculating those directions for it to complete 
    its task and in some cases even tasks. This is what makes Automata so complicated. The hundreds of thousands of parts need to follow directions for the machine to 
    complete a certain task it's giving. Everything has a purpose. That could be anything the creator comes up with, writing, speaking, dancing, playing music, and many more possibilities.
    The ''Draughtsman-Writer'' is an automaton machine that can draw 4 different pictures. It is moves by a series of levers that are guided by precisely carved grooves in disks.

      The Influence of Automata in the modern day
      </h1> 
      <p>
      Sadly enough automata is an art form that is mostly only viewable in museums, in movies, games, and comics. There are still automata's around, there are some creative geniuses that make working automaton machine's
      but there aren't any built today that have the same charm as the ones created by the true inventors. Or are there?
     <p><p> 
      For this project, I did some digging and found that there is a movie called ''Hugo'' that's about a boy who tries to fix an automaton machine that can draw to connect with his father. I watched the movie because I 
      wanted to see if the automaton machine worked and if I could learn something from the movie about automata. I found out that the machine used in the movie was operated by a computer and a series of magnets. The movie 
      wasn't very educational on the subject, although it did give me some inside on the subject in a different way.
     <p><p>
      Mostly on the reason that automata's are so interesting to us humans, especially in this digital age. Almost every piece of technology works on wires, even wireless, and we don't understand half of the technology use. With automata, 
      you don't have any of that. Not everyone understands it but it's the fact that this machine moves and comes to life without the need for a power supply and it following directions that the creature presets in the machine. Making mechanics 
      that will guide the machine to move. Making future movements with calculations in a machine if you will. In a sense, there is a magic in it, that I feel like a lot of our modern technology lacks. Games, movies are comics are media that still 
      working with the subject though. Coming up with new ideas to make the old art form, work in futuristic environments. As advanced as we're getting I still hope automata will make its return in the future.

      The Link between Automata and my robot (CLE-product)
      </h1> 
      <p>
    The link between my robot and the subject automata is that in the production of both you make movements that will guide your device. With automata 
    that is through mechanical part and we do it through ''Makecode Adafruit'' and now Javascript. In both cases, you calculate the movement the device 
    is gonna make. We also learn to make our robot usable forever, like in a loop. 
    <p><p>
    Both devices also use inputs and outputs. The inputs for our robots are 
    the option on the Circuit Playground, like the speaker, the mic, and the other options. As for the outputs we can use things like lights, sensors, and 
    many more things. For the automata machine, the inputs are the parts inside it that allow it to move. The output is the things that make the machine 
    start working. The things that create directions for it to follow so it can move, make sound, etc. It's so interesting how old technology like 
    automata is still similar to the technology we use today. In our case for our robots.
